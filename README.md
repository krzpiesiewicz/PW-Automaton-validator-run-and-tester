# PW-Automaton-validator-run-and-tester
Multi-process system gathering statistics of finite automatons' runs on words. It is my design and implementation for a task in Concurrent Programming course at MIMUW in 2017 (description of the task in English: [AUTOMATA TASK.pdf](https://github.com/krzpiesiewicz/PW-Automaton-validator-run-and-tester/blob/master/AUTOMATA%20TASK.pdf)).

Communication between processes is realised by message queues and POSIX pipes. You can find more details about my design and implementation in Polish here: [DESIGN.pdf](https://github.com/krzpiesiewicz/PW-Automaton-validator-run-and-tester/blob/master/DESIGN.pdf).
